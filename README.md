# Hello_World

I am Jung (pronounced Juneeeeee~). 

I will turn 24 in 2018. I am from New Zealand.

I was originally born in city of Fuqing (bro, it is not F##king, it Foo Chin), China.

That is pretty much everything about me, a poor and incompetent uni student who just wondered into the world of hardcore gangster as coders.

Please be Friendly with me. I love you all. 

I wonder what I will become in 10 years, maybe you will see me begging for ciggies on Queen Street and living under Grafton Bridge, or maybe, I actually achieve something good and people actually know me over here. 

From New Zealand, with Tim tams and love. (○´3｀)ﾉ⌒♡
