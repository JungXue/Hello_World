That is pretty much everything about me, a poor and incompetent uni student who just wondered into the world of hardcore gangster as coders.

Please be Friendly with me. I love you all. 

I wonder what I will become in 10 years, maybe I will actually achieve something good and people actually know me over here. 

From New Zealand, with Tim tams and love. (○´3｀)ﾉ⌒♡

I will send a packet of Tim Tams to first ever person that said hi to me on github, because you are special, no matter where you are. Send you hi message to jxue533@aucklanduni.ac.nz.
