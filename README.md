# Hello_World

I am Jung (pronounced Juneeeeee~). My family name is Xue (pronounced share), my grandfather's initial is, XXX, don't mess with him he will go Vin Diesel on you.  

I will turn 24 in 2018. I am from New Zealand, more specifically from the friendly neighbourhood of Tokoroa.

I was originally born in city of [Fuqing](https://www.google.co.nz/maps/place/Fuqing,+Fuzhou,+Fujian,+China/@25.5773336,119.0941618,10z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x34402c8a55f16c8f:0x35dc031cc2851967!8m2!3d25.721143!4d119.384334) (Foo Chin), China.

That is pretty much everything about me, a poor and incompetent uni student who just wondered into the world of hardcore gangster as coders.

Please be Friendly with me. I love you all. 

I wonder what I will become in 10 years, maybe I will actually achieve something good and people actually know me over here. 


From New Zealand, with Tim tams and love. (○´3｀)ﾉ⌒♡

I am thinking about some other names that I may use, ABSOLUTELY no one actually pronounce my name right, not even my parents, so maybe chaging it to a similar but more readible name may make things easier. :thinking:
